# Tetris-Clone

This project follows the freecodecamp youtube video "Python and Pygame Tutorial - Build Tetris! Full GameDev Course" to implement a working tetris game in python.
It comes with a menu screen, along with a "high-score" log which tracks and compares game scores over multiple sessions.
